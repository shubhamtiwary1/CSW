         <strong>Bio</strong>: I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay. Before joining IITB in 2013, 
         I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2010 and 2006 respectively. I was advised by Prof. 
         Hari Balakrishnan. After my Ph.D., I worked at Movik Networks, a startup in the telecom space, for 3 years before joining IITB. 
         Earlier, I obtained a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2004. <br>
